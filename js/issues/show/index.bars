                    CA.GOV.VOTE is an issue-based voting platform.
                    It was built in the hopes that, one day, we will be able to vote on issues - not on political personalities.
                    Its time we had our say, not on the basis of general party lines, but on a per-issue basis.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At CA.GOV.VOTE, you're allowed to vote for each of the topics, and you can change your vote at any time.
                    We have security measures in place to validate authentic voters.
                    Spread the word - let's show that we really care about our country and its policies.
                </p>

                    CA.GOV.VOTE is not affiliated in any way with the Canadian government or any political parties.
